## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 661c1f7: `LankaValidationError` is a `LankaError` of kind `schema`. The validation port's failure extended `Error` directly, so `LankaError.is` — and everything built on it: the HTTP policy's error middleware, an application branching on `kind` — never saw a refused body, while the request layer's own "200 that was not JSON" was a `schema` failure. `name` stays `LankaValidationError`, `status` stays 422, `errors` is still the message list; the described issues are also on `issues`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3331c47: Four promises the code did not keep, each pinned by a test that failed before the fix.

    **`lanka`**

    - `IALankaGatewayConfig.validationService` was accepted and read by nothing: a
      gateway handed a test double got the real validator. It is now
      `this.validationService` on `ALankaGateway` and `validationService` in the
      functional context, defaulting to `lankaStandardValidator`.
    - `ILankaScenario.cleanup` is "called when the scenario is removed from the
      registry". It was never called. `unregister` and `clear` — and with them
      `dispose()` — now run it, containing what it throws.
    - `bootstrap()` is idempotent while a bootstrap is still IN FLIGHT: two callers
      arriving before the first plan finished used to run every service twice.
    - The scenario self-registration pool no longer grows by the whole barrel on
      every bootstrap and on every failed locator lookup.

    **`@lankajs/plugin-http`**

    - The CSRF header is sent only to the application's own origins — the API's,
      the page's, and any named in the new `csrf.origins`. A gateway writing the
      whole URL of a third party used to carry the token there.

    **`@lankajs/browser`**

    - `lankaCookies.set` over the Cookie Store API turned a `Date` expiry into a
      timestamp and then multiplied that timestamp as a number of days.
    - A foreign cookie with a stray `%` in its value no longer makes every
      `get`, `getAll` and `watch` throw `URIError`.

    **`@lankajs/plugin-sse`**

    - Subscribing again to an event type that was dropped no longer attaches a
      second listener to the same connection, so handlers stop firing twice.

- 3331c47: Three more ways a change arrives: a WebSocket, GraphQL subscriptions, a gRPC
  server stream — each shaped the way SSE already was.

    **`lanka`** gains the `lanka/stream` subsystem: the protocol-free half of
    realtime, which every one of the four transports needs and none of them owns.
    `ILankaServerEventTransport` (the port), `ALankaStreamBridge` and
    `createLankaStreamBridge` (a wire event → a scenario, both styles),
    `createLankaStreamTriggerContext` (the "came from outside" marker),
    `ALankaStreamTransport` (dispatch plus the reconnect ladder — a subclass writes
    `open` and `close`) and `lankaStream` (bridges attached, lifetime owned,
    teardown in the order that matters).

    It is in core because that is where both callers already look, and it is shared
    rather than copied because the marker is the piece whose failure is silent.

    **`@lankajs/plugin-websocket`** — `LankaWebSocketTransport` behind the same port
    `lankaSse` takes, so a proxy that strips `text/event-stream` costs one line of
    configuration. Plus the half SSE has not got: `send`, an outbox bounded and
    flushed on open, and a heartbeat that turns a half-open socket into a reconnect.

    **`@lankajs/plugin-graphql`** — `LankaGraphqlRequest`, whose whole reason is
    that GraphQL answers `200 OK` with an `errors` array: it becomes `LankaError`
    with `kind: "domain"`, while a partial result stays a success.
    `ALankaGraphqlGateway` / `createLankaGraphqlGateway` for `query` and `mutate`,
    and `LankaGraphqlSubscriptionTransport` speaking `graphql-transport-ws`.

    **`@lankajs/plugin-grpc`** — gRPC-Web framing, the trailers block, and sixteen
    status codes mapped onto five failure kinds, with the message codec left to
    whatever generated the message types. `ALankaGrpcGateway` for unary calls and
    `LankaGrpcStreamTransport` for a server stream read as named events.

    **`@lankajs/plugin-sse`** publishes exactly the names it always did — its `api/`
    report is byte-identical — and now re-exports the shared half from
    `lanka/stream` instead of declaring its own.

    **`@lankajs/tool-eslint`** — `lanka/layer-style` learns three role keys:
    `stream-bridge` (which accepts the old `sse-bridge` names as the same pair),
    `graphql-gateway` and `grpc-gateway`.

- 3331c47: What a consumer can test, and what a developer can see.

    **`@lankajs/tool-testing`**

    - `createLankaFakeTransport` answers per endpoint. `routes` takes a substring, a
      pattern or a predicate over `(endpoint, options)`; `times` exhausts a route so
      the next one answers, which is how "failed once, then succeeded" is written;
      `delayMs` is how a loading state is asserted. Nothing matching falls through to
      the config's own `body` / `status` / `failWith`, so every existing call behaves
      exactly as it did. `callsTo(match)` filters the recorded calls the same way.
    - `createLankaEventRecorder` records what crossed the bus and answers the
      question the scenario layer exists for: did doing this make that fire. `of`,
      `count`, `all`, and a `waitFor` that REJECTS on its deadline naming the event —
      and resolves immediately for one that already crossed, because waiting for
      something that has happened is the classic race.
    - `createLankaLogRecorder` asserts what the framework DECIDED rather than how it
      printed it. It turns the log on, because a recorder that only added a sink
      would answer an empty array and the test would pass having proved nothing;
      `stop()` puts every flag back, and `console: "silence"` keeps the run quiet.
    - `waitForLankaIdle` returns when nothing is on the wire and the work it started
      has settled, and rejects naming how many requests are outstanding. It replaces
      `await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 0))`, which drains one turn and works
      until the chain behind the request grows a link.
    - `registerLankaFakes(lanka, fakes)` and `renderWithLanka({ fakes })` say which
      double stands for which name across all four locators. Doubles need not extend
      any base — that they do not is what makes them cheap.
    - `createLankaFakeScenario` remembers what it carried, in `emitted`.

    **`lanka`**

    - `lankaEventBus.addObserver` — the sixth extension point. An observer is told
      what became of each dispatch (`delivered`, `stopped` by whom, or `invalid` by
      the event's own schema) after the whole chain has run, and cannot decide
      anything. It exists because a middleware sees only the chain ahead of itself
      and a diagnostic tool's is registered first: "which middleware stopped this"
      was a question nothing could answer. The unobserved path is guarded by an
      empty-list check, so a bus nobody watches pays a length comparison.

    **`@lankajs/plugin-devtools`**

    - `stoppedBy` is filled for the first time. It was in the type, in the snapshot
      and in the guide, and no code path could ever set it.
    - The snapshot gains `requests` (endpoint, duration, whether it arrived, timed
      through `useRequestMiddleware` and rethrown untouched), `scenarios` (the
      register, so "nobody is listening" and "it never fired" are visible at all),
      and `outcome` on every event.
    - `subscribe` replaces polling, coalesced to one call per microtask; `clear`
      empties the history; `exposeAs` puts the inspector on `globalThis` under a name
      of your choosing, in development only and removed on teardown.
    - The panel grew four tabs, a filter, copy-as-JSON, clear and a collapse. It
      redraws on `subscribe` when you pass it and still polls when you do not, and
      `renderLankaDevtoolsPanel(getSnapshot, container)` keeps working unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 3331c47: Four more promises the code did not keep. Each is pinned by a test that fails on
  the old code and passes on the new.

    ## `@lankajs/storage` — major, and why

    **The storage key hash is keyed by the secret.** `LankaCipher` hashes a key NAME
    because the name says what is stored under it. The hash was a plain SHA-256, and
    a plain hash of a short predictable word is not a disguise — it is a lookup. The
    dozen names an application actually uses fit in a dictionary anybody can build in
    a second, and the common ones (`token`, `session`, `user`) are in published
    rainbow tables already. `LankaEncryptor.hashKey` is now HMAC-SHA-256 keyed by the
    secret, so the table has to be rebuilt by somebody who already has the secret —
    and somebody who has the secret can read the values anyway.

    **`clear()` removes what the cipher wrote, not the whole page.** It called the
    adapter's own `clear()`, which for `localStorage` empties everything: the theme,
    the language, the consent record, another library's data, and
    `@lankajs/browser`'s release-guard version — so the next visit dropped every
    cache as well. Entries now sit under a namespace and only those are removed. A
    store that cannot list its keys (Cache Storage) still gets the old call, which
    there means its own named cache and is already scoped.

    `ILankaAsyncStorageAdapter` gains an OPTIONAL `keys()`, which is what makes the
    scoped clear possible; `LankaWebStorageAdapter` implements it. An adapter a
    consumer already wrote keeps compiling.

    **Nothing you read is lost.** An entry written under the previous scheme is
    carried over on the first read of that key — rewritten under the new name, the
    old copy removed — and `clear()` sweeps the old shape as well. It is a major
    because the on-disk format changed and a downgrade would not find the data, not
    because a correct call breaks.

    ## `@lankajs/browser` — major

    **`get` is the inverse of `set` again.** `set` takes `string | object` and writes
    JSON for the object and the string itself for the string. `get` JSON-parsed
    whatever it found, so a string that looks like a number came back as one:
    `"1234567890123456789"` returned with its last digits rounded away, `"true"`
    returned a boolean, and `"null"` returned `null` — which `get` uses for "no such
    cookie", so `has()` reported an existing cookie as absent. Only a leading `{` or
    `[` is parsed now, because those are the only shapes `set` ever writes. The
    signature `get<T = string>` finally tells the truth.

    Major because a consumer relying on the numeric auto-parse gets a string.

    ## `lanka` — patch

    **`getEventLogs()` returns records in the order the bus saw them.** They are kept
    per event TYPE, and the no-type call concatenated those lists — so `limit` took
    the tail of whichever type the registry held last rather than the most recent
    events. A debugging tool that reorders the evidence sends the reader after the
    wrong cause. `ILankaEventLog` gains an optional `sequence`, which is what the
    sort uses: a timestamp has millisecond resolution and a burst dispatches many
    events inside one.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- `@lanka_di/*` stays external in the bundle, which is what makes an installed package wirable at all.

    `1.0.0` shipped with those specifiers resolved at build time, so the repository's own empty fixture went into `dist`: an installed `lanka` resolved every gateway, scenario and singleton against `{}`, threw `not found` for all of them, and the consumer's `@lanka_di` alias had nothing left to attach to. Verified against the published tarball — `dist/index.js` contained no `@lanka_di` import at all. Left external, the specifier survives into `dist` and the `.d.ts`, and the consumer's bundler alias and `tsconfig` paths answer it.

    Four fixes ride along, each with the test that names it:

    - `register()` was honoured by two locators out of four, so a registration against the other two was accepted and ignored.
    - A lazy hook advertised `then`, which made it look like a promise to anything that duck-types one — `await` on a hook returned the hook.
    - A stopped event was still replayed to a later subscriber, because the buffer filled before the chain could refuse it.
    - `resolvePath` stripped a leading slash it had already returned for, and `findExportedClass` resolved names a barrel never exported.

    Only the packages whose published output actually changes are versioned here: the externalisation is declared for all nineteen, but the other fourteen never import `@lanka_di` and their bundles are byte-identical.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- The first release: nineteen packages, one framework.

    `lanka` is the core — bootstrap, config, role, locator, gateway, validation,
    mock, errors, scenario, viewmodel and logger. Nine `@lankajs/*` modules an
    application installs one at a time, five plugins that occupy a declared extension
    point, and four tools that run before runtime: the `@lanka_di` alias for six
    bundlers, the boundary lint rules, the test kit and the skill installer.

    The one rule everything follows from is checked rather than agreed: imports go
    one way, and `@lankajs/tool-eslint` names the file and the line when they do not.
    What every package promises is written down in `api/`, and from this version a
    name there is kept until a major.

    `1.0.0` rather than `0.1.0` says the five extension points have settled: request
    middleware, the in-flight counter, bus middleware, logger sinks, and `use()`
    itself. Three plugins occupy them between them, which is what made the shapes
    answerable rather than imagined.
